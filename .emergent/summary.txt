<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to complete a 2D side-scrolling shooter game built with Phaser and TypeScript.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Core Gameplay**: Implement proper firing, enemy killing mechanics, and ensure all weapons work correctly.
2.  **Infinite Scrolling**: The game should be an infinite runner where the player moves to the right on a flat, thick platform, and the scene loops endlessly.
3.  **Projectile Mechanics**:
    *   Projectile ranges should be realistic.
    *   Assault rifle bullets should be very small.
4.  **Laser Blaster**: Implement a continuous laser beam that deals cumulative damage over time (e.g., 5 seconds of total contact kills an enemy, even if contact is intermittent).
5.  **Biome System**: Implement 5 distinct biomes (Jungle, Desert, Urban, Arctic, Space). Each biome must have its own unique background wallpaper, platform tiles, and enemy skin/type.
6.  **Biome Transitions**:
    *   Transitions between biomes should be seamless, triggered automatically every 3 minutes.
    *   A Teleporting in 10... countdown should appear 10 seconds before a transition, with the text being 75% smaller than default.
    *   The destination biome should be a surprise (no Next Biome: display).
7.  **Level Design**: The game should feature a single, continuous, thick, flat platform for the player to run on in all biomes. No sky platforms.
8.  **Difficulty Scaling**:
    *   **Easy**: Enemies shoot straight.
    *   **Hard**: Enemies shoot towards the player's location.
    *   **Cursed**: More enemies spawn, and all shoot towards the player.
9.  **UI & Branding**:
    *   The browser tab title should be Degen Force.
    *   The favicon should be the Degen Force logo.
    *   The main menu should feature the Degen Force logo and a jungle background.
10. **Deployment**: The application must be deployable. This involved fixing build errors and restructuring the project to meet the deployment environment's expectations.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a complete, frontend-only 2D side-scrolling shooter game built with Phaser and TypeScript. All user-requested features have been implemented. The game features a fully functional biome system with 5 unique biomes, each with distinct backgrounds and platform tiles. Biome transitions occur automatically every 3 minutes, preceded by a 10-second countdown. The laser weapon deals cumulative damage as requested. The level design consists of a single, continuous flat platform. Difficulty scaling affects enemy shooting patterns and spawn rates. The project has also been refactored to be deployment-ready, which included creating a minimal backend to satisfy the deployment pipeline's requirements.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Updating the website's favicon and title to Degen Force.
-   **Status**: NONE (COMPLETED will be marked only if user has verified it by testing)
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool (A quick visual check of the browser tab is sufficient).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues. All user requests from the session have been addressed.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no in-progress tasks.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Task 1:** (P1) Verify the favicon and title change in the browser tab.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Biome System Rework (Major Bug Fix)**:
  - Completely resolved the long-standing issue where platform tiles would not update during biome transitions. The final solution involved removing the Phaser Tilemap system and dynamically generating all platforms from sprite/image assets, clearing all old platforms on transition ().
- **Level Design Refinement**:
  - Iterated on platform design multiple times based on user feedback, ultimately implementing a single, continuous, thick, flat platform with no gaps or sky platforms for all biomes ().
- **Difficulty & Enemy AI**:
  - Implemented difficulty-based enemy shooting AI (Easy: straight, Hard: aim at player, Cursed: aim at player) in .
  - Adjusted enemy spawn logic for different difficulties in .
- **Laser Weapon Cumulative Damage**:
  - Reworked the  to track damage dealt to each individual enemy, so damage persists through intermittent contact.
- **Auto-Teleport System**:
  - Implemented an automatic biome transition every 3 minutes.
  - Added a 10-second countdown (Teleporting in X...) that appears before the transition.
  - Removed the persistent biome timer from the UI and resized the countdown text as requested (, ).
- **Deployment Fixes**:
  - **Project Restructure**: Moved all game code and assets into an  directory to align with deployment expectations.
  - **Minimal Backend**: Created a dummy FastAPI backend in  to satisfy the full-stack deployment pipeline.
  - **Dependency Fixes**: Corrected  by adding a  script and moving the  dependency.
  - **Asset Localization**: Downloaded all CDN-hosted image assets, stored them locally in , and updated  to use local paths, making the project self-contained and deployable.
- **UI and Branding**:
  - Restored the original title screen using the localized Degen Force logo and jungle background ().
  - Updated the favicon and browser tab title to Degen Force in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Biome platform tiles not updating.
-   **Recurrence count**: High
-   **Status**: RESOLVED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Game Engine**: Phaser 3
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Build Tool**: Vite
-   **Deployment**: The project is a frontend game but is structured as a full-stack application with a minimal backend to satisfy the Emergent deployment pipeline.

**key DB schema**

**changes in tech stack**
N/A

**All files of reference**
-   : Core file containing logic for platform generation, biome transitions, enemy spawning, and game timers.
-   : Manages all UI elements, including the teleport countdown.
-   : Contains the difficulty-based enemy shooting logic.
-   : Implements the cumulative damage for the laser.
-   : Defines asset keys and configurations for all 5 biomes.
-   : The main HTML file where the title and favicon are set.
-   : The manifest for all game assets, now pointing to local files.
-   : The minimal backend created to enable deployment.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is very large and handles many responsibilities. It could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more specialized manager classes (e.g., a , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   : A simple health check endpoint in the minimal backend () to pass deployment health checks.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   This is a frontend-only Phaser game. The  directory contains a minimal dummy backend created solely to make the project pass the deployment system's checks, which expect a full-stack structure. All game development should occur within the  directory.
-   The user is very specific about gameplay feel, particularly platforming. The final implementation uses a single, flat, continuous, thick platform. Any changes to level design should be confirmed with the user.
-   All external asset URLs (CDNs) have been replaced with local assets stored in  to ensure successful deployments.
